Testing Notes
------------

- Had to mess with VirtualBox USB settings to get the phone to show up. Make sure the device is passed through.
- ADB kept saying "device not authorized." Had to unlock the phone and tap "Allow" on the USB debugging prompt.
- Java 8 gave me JAR errors with ABE. Switched to JDK 11 and it worked fine.
- Autopsy is slow on my VM. Give it time to load the data.
- The contacts2.db path might be different depending on the Android version. Check the extracted folder.
- TODO: Figure out how to script Autopsy. Their Python API looks complicated.
- Reports look decent in Chrome but kinda wonky in Firefox. Need to tweak the CSS maybe.
