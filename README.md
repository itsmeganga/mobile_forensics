# mobile_forensics
Hi all, this is my Android forensics project on Kali Linux! It uses ADB to extract call logs, ABE to unpack backups, and SQLite for analysis. Autopsy’s manual, but I added a Python script for HTML reports. Built in VirtualBox, it’s ethical and MIT-licensed. See README for setup. Feedback welcome!
