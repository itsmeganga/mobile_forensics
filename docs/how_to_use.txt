How to Use This Project
----------------------

1. Set up your environment:
   - Install ADB, Autopsy, and Java on Kali Linux.
   - Download abe.jar and put it in the project folder.
   - Connect your Android phone and enable USB debugging.

2. Extract data:
   Run: ./scripts/get_data.sh <device_id> data/backups
   - Get <device_id> from `adb devices`.
   - This saves a .ab backup file.

3. Unpack the backup:
   Run: python3 scripts/unpack_backup.py data/backups/backup_<timestamp>.ab data/extracted
   - This gives you the raw data.

4. Analyze data:
   Run: python3 scripts/dig_data.py data/extracted data/reports
   - This pulls call logs and saves them.
   - Then open Autopsy, load the extracted data, and save its report to data/reports.

5. Make a report:
   Run: python3 scripts/make_report.py data/reports/call_logs.txt data/reports
   - This creates an HTML report.

Tips:
- If ADB fails, check USB debugging and authorization.
- Java issues? Try JDK 11.
- Autopsy is a bit finicky; make sure it sees the extracted folder.
